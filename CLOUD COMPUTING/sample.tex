\begin{abstract}
Chatting refers to any kind of communication that offers a real-time transmission of messages from sender to the receiver. Chatting is a method of using technology to bring people and ideas together despite the geographical barriers. The technology to provide the chatting facility has been available for years, but the acceptance is quite recent. The most important features are easy and quick communication,unlimited data transfer without the size restriction.

\section{Introduction}
To start off with the project we proposed a plan for the project. The project we worked on is a Chat application which allows instant Chatting between two or more individuals.We decided that this should be an Android application. The end result will be instant messaging service at a high end level.The tools used for this is Android studio and Fire-base.

This paper states that since there is a lot of changes which
had occurred in the recent past and the customers are changing
their needs from time to time, it has become a necessity to
build a chat application that matches the present crowd. This
system was mainly developed to provide a chat room for all
kind of educationalist by offering them a platform to chat and
solve study related queries

\section{Design}
Non-functional requirements:
Ease of use: The user interface must be easy to navigate, understand and use
Availability: The application must be available to use as and when required.
Hardware requirements:
Operating system: Windows
Processor: Intel core
Ram: 1 GB

\section{Results \& Discussion}
In the results section, We got a fully working chat application. The Login section of the application worked as it successfully authenticated the user. There will be a small lag in displaying your profile. That is because the app tires to verify with the main server which stores all the credentials. The server cloud stores all the user information as well as the messages sent and received.
The data (empirical findings) obtained by our project is as follows:
\begin{center}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The projected data shown in the above figure the random id's shown is the unique id for each message. Each and ever message sent from sender to receiver and vice versa is stored in the fire-base with a unique storage id. This will be helpful to track messages easily to maintain security. Under the id section there are two headings, message and user. The message represents what the message was. The user represents who sent the message.
	\item This work is significant because in our app we make sure that the security is improved in the project and maintain a strong communication between the sender and the receiver. Hence strong encryption method is used in this application.Hence the Security part of the project is what is significant compared to other works
	\item  The application which we developed is actually little weaker compared to the other works but we are aiming to make it better and more secure.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion \& Future Work}
So Hence after developing the complete app we were able to communicate using the Confab app and the messages is being stored as expected. So to conclude this app can be used to Chat with more than 2 people also. The Future work of this app is to come up with a group, where many people can send messages, and also the option to send Large medias and so on without loss in quality. Also in future we can come up with a payment option where people dont have to depend on gpay and so on. IC can be further implemented in the area of voice and
video calling and can be used in the large organizations by
hosting the application. IC can by further implemented by
providing security algorithms to encrypt the data transfer
without the size restrictions for a larger scale.
